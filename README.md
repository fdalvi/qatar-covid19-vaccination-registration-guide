# COVID-19 Vaccination Registration Guide for Qatar

The government of the State of Qatar launched a [website](https://app-covid19.moph.gov.qa/en/instructions.html) to register for the _free_ national vaccination drive. However, a significant portion of the population may lack the technical know-how to register themselves. This project aims to bridge this gap and provide easy-to-follow instructions for people to register themselves in multiple languages.
